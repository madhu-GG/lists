# lists #
##### A list API and a simple array implementation I wrote in C. ######

## What I will be doing ##

<p align="justify">I am planning on adding more implementations based on this API. I will extend the API itself once I find it inadequate for what I am doing. So, basically wing it. </p>

## Branches, API and implementations ##

<p align="justify"> The API will have its own branch. The implementations will be on their own branch. For example, API will be on branch API and the array implementation will be on branch impl-array. </p>

## Versions ##

<p align="justify"> I will start by having MAJOR.MINOR.API_CHANGE version where MINOR > 0 version will be no changes to API. When MINOR is 0, the versioning will be MAJOR.0.API_CHANGE and the largest API_CHANGE version that won't be changed for 1 week will be considered as the final API for that MAJOR version. At this point MAJOR.0 will be frozen and MAJOR.1 will begin with the work on the implementations. MAJOR will move when I need more out of the list. MINOR will move when I learn to have a better implementation. API_CHANGE will move fast after the MAJOR moves once. It will stop once I am confident with the design of the current API. </P>
